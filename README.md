<h2> What security outcome was achieved: </h2>

Maintaining cloud resource security and visibility is key to preventing breaches. This project demonstrates how to use Microsoft Defender for Cloud to monitor misconfigurations, assess Secure Score, and improve overall cloud security posture. It proves my ability to identify and remediate risks across IaaS and PaaS services in Azure.
